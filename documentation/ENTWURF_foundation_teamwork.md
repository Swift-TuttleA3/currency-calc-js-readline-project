# Our Foundation:

The dynamics in a heterogeneous team can be challenging, especially when there are different personalities and communication styles. Therefore, we try to orient ourselves to the following guidelines without a fixed prioritization of individual points:


## Acknowledge Individual Differences

   - Each team member brings different strengths, weaknesses, and perspectives. It is important to respect and appreciate these differences.
   - Dominant team members may tend to take up more space, while shy members may speak less. Recognizing these differences is the first step.
   - Sometimes, space cannot be distributed evenly, so compromises need to be negotiated.

## Establish Communication Rules

   - A fair framework can help balance communication.
   - Set clear time limits for contributions to ensure that everyone has a chance to speak.
   - Encourage and demand active listening. Encourage team members to listen attentively and respond to each other.
   - Everyone is a water carrier and a leader! Ensure that everyone feels comfortable to empower different voices and promote different approaches.

## Empathy and Sensitivity

   - Sensitize yourself and the team to the different communication styles and needs of all members. In normal circumstances, do not focus on weaknesses but highlight strengths.
   - Dominant members could learn to step back and give others space, while shy members could be encouraged to express their opinions. However, also consider that such structures can work effectively and in consensus under certain circumstances.

## Establish a Feedback Culture
   - Regular feedback is crucial. Encourage open conversations about communication patterns and how they affect the team.
   - Point out the knowledge and strengths of others and how their contributions have a positive impact.
   - Emphasize that constructive feedback should be seen as an opportunity for improvement, not as criticism.
   - Addressing deficiencies and substantial criticism of a person or their work should be done outside of group work.

## Acceptance and Flexibility
   - Sometimes, we need to accept that not everyone progresses at the same pace. Some team members may be faster, others slower.
   - Flexibility means addressing individual needs without compromising the overall performance of the team.

## Moderation and Leadership
   - A good moderator or team leader can balance discussions and ensure that everyone is heard.
   - Everyone can be a role model for others.

## Overall, we see the key for us in a combination of structure, empathy, and flexibility.
### Every team is unique, just as the mood and performance within a fixed team are not the same every day.
### Therefore, we actively strive to pay attention to the specific needs and dynamics of our team and our fellow human beings and to communicate our own openly!ðŸ˜Š
