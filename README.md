# Currency Converter Project

## Overview

This project is a simple currency converter written in JavaScript. User interaction occurs exclusively through the terminal using the `readline-sync` library.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to develop an effective work and team structure. We will collaborate on a manageable project to improve teamwork, communication, task allocation, and our general understanding of new or unfamiliar work techniques.
Before selecting a topic and conducting research, we will establish a common structure and approach. 
Especially in creative processes, defining a consensus-driven yet flexible framework can be essential to optimize available resources.
Defining content and time frames for our chosen intermediate steps, along with regular feedback, will serve as a straightforward but stable framework for synergistic collaboration.
From a technical perspective, our focus will be on code review, pair programming, and a general understanding of using Git. The set goal should serve as assistance rather than an obstacle.

An important secondary goal(and prerequisite for achieving the main goal) is to create and maintain a conducive, creative, open, and relaxed work atmosphere.
